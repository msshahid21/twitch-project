# Codecademy-Twitch Visualisation Cumulative Project

In collaboration with the Twitch Science Team, this project from Codecademy includes approximately 800,000 rows of Twitch users' stream (video) viewing data and chat room usage data. Using this data-set I was required to analyse the data using SQL and also create visualisations of the provided data.

NOTE: All .csv files and .png files mentioned in the Part 1 Markdown File and the Python script respectively are located in the Exhibits folder.
