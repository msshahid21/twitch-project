# Codecademy-Twitch Visualisation Cumulative Project

In collaboration with the Twitch Science Team, this project from Codecademy includes approximately 800,000 rows of Twitch users' stream (video) viewing data and chat room usage data. Using this data-set I was required to analyse the data using SQL and also create visualisations of the provided data.
